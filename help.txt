SOME CPP  BASICS

WHAT IS STD?
-> it is a standard namespace provided by a cpp standard library, which inclues generic functions like cout, cin, sort etc..
-> if we use standard namespace in our program all these names will come out to a global scope and might conflict with our local namings.
-> so we avoid "using namespace std".
-> now to access all the functions from a standard library we have to use std::fn_name(), it just telling to use a fn_name from a std library.

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN?
-> to compile a program in terminal type the command 'g++ filename.cpp -o exec_file'.
-> g++ is a compiler for compiling cpp programs.
-> to execute navigate to exec_file in this case ./exec_file and enter.
